# ERModsMerger
Simple tool to merge Elden Ring mods.

NOTE: This tool just got released and still under testing. Thanks to report if you have issues.
## Usage
Download the latest release, extract the zipped ERModsMerger.exe, launch it and let it guide you through the process.

If you use [ModEngine2](https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2) place ERModsMerger.exe in the same folder and edit config_eldenring.toml as follow:
```
mods = [
    { enabled = true, name = "default", path = "MergedMods" }
]
```
